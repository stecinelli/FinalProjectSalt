The site consists of a timer that can be adjusted for as many minutes as you want. This timer will triggers an alarm at the end of the requested time, and you can upload the sound of your preference or you can choose one from the available sounds.
In addition, the website also controls which group member will be the next to control the keyboard, facilitating the organization of a team that wants to work on MOB programming.
Last but not least you may save your team configuration and also can scan a QR code to share the MOB timer with everyone.

Oh and of course you will also look to an image of cute kittens to brighten up your work day!


## What is MOP programming?

Mob programming (sometimes informally called mobbing or ensemble programming) is a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer. This is similar to pair programming where two people sit at the same computer and collaborate on the same code at the same time. With mob programming, the collaboration is extended to everyone on the team, while still using a single computer for writing the code and inputting it into the code base.

## Website setup
